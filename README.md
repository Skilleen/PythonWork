# PythonWork
A variety of work I have done with Python as I learn the language. 

Changeling - A puzzle game that takes 2 words of equal length and a max amount of steps. It will try to change the first word into the second in those steps.

Bridge - A helper program for the game bridge. Multiple functions to help the player decide what to do with their hand.

Trinary Tree - I created a trinary search tree and multiple functions to make use of it.

Circular List - Functions that create and manipulate a circular list (linked list in the form of a circle)

Binary Search vs Trinary Search - A set of expierments that tested the complexity of binary and trinary searches. The conclusions are stated in the write up.
